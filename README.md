Great to hear it worked! Here's an explanation of the commands:

1. **Compiling (`kotlinc HelloWorld.kt -include-runtime -d HelloWorld.jar`):**
   - `kotlinc`: Kotlin compiler command.
   - `HelloWorld.kt`: The Kotlin source file you're compiling.
   - `-include-runtime`: Includes the Kotlin runtime in the JAR. Necessary for running the program as it contains necessary libraries and the Kotlin standard library.
   - `-d HelloWorld.jar`: Destination flag (`-d`). Compiles the code into a JAR (Java Archive) file named `HelloWorld.jar`. JAR files bundle together Kotlin/Java classes and associated metadata and resources (like text, images).

2. **Running the program (`java -jar HelloWorld.jar`):**
   - `java`: Java Virtual Machine (JVM) command to run Java applications.
   - `-jar HelloWorld.jar`: Instructs the JVM to run the specified JAR file. The `-jar` option is used to run JAR files. `HelloWorld.jar` is the file you created during compilation, which contains your compiled Kotlin code.

Essentially, the compiling step translates your Kotlin code into bytecode that the JVM can understand, and the running step executes this bytecode on the JVM.
